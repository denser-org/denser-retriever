# Unit Tests

<Callout>
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the unit tests to verify that the installation was successful.
</Callout>

The unit tests are implemented in files starting with `test_` under [tests](https://github.com/denser-org/denser-retriever/tree/main/tests) directory. We have various unit tests to test data loader, elasticsearch, vector search, reranker, and the general retriever. For example, we run the general retriever unit test with the following command.

```bash
poetry run python -m pytest tests/test_retriever_general.py
```

Alternatively, we can run all unit tests with the following command.

```bash
poetry run python -m pytest tests
```
