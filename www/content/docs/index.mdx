## What is an AI Retriever?

![](./retriever_dog.png)

In the world of AI, a "retriever" is a tool used to sift through vast amounts of data to find information that is relevant to a user's query. Think of it as a highly intelligent search engine that helps AI systems understand and gather the exact information needed to answer questions effectively. The Retriever is the cornerstone of the Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, playing a crucial role in delivering an accurate and seamless experience in AI applications.

## How Does Denser Retriever Work?

Denser Retriever integrates multiple search technologies into a single platform. It utilizes **gradient boosting (xgboost)** machine learning technique to combine:

- **Keyword-based searches** that focus on fetching precisely what the query mentions.
- **Vector databases** that are great for finding a wide range of potentially relevant answers.
- **Machine Learning rerankers** that fine-tune the results to ensure the most relevant answers top the list.

## Use Cases of Denser Retriever

Denser Retriever can significantly enhance a variety of AI applications across different industries and domains. Here are a few examples.
