## Overview

The following diagram illustrates a Denser Retriever, which consists of three components:

import DenserRetriever from './experiments/denser-retriever.png'

- **Keyword search** relies on traditional search techniques that use exact keyword matching. We use [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/targz.html) in Denser Retriever.
- **Vector search** uses neural network models to encode both the query and the documents into dense vector representations in a high-dimensional space. We use [Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) and [snowflake-arctic-embed-m](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/arctic-embed?tab=readme-ov-file) model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB/BEIR [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) for each of their size variants.
- **A ML cross-encoder re-ranker** can be utilized to further boost accuracy over these two retriever approaches above. We use [cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2), which has a good balance between accuracy and inference latency.

## Requirements

To get started, we need

- Install `denser-retriever` python package, see [here](./install/installation)
- Install `Elasticsearch` and `Milvus`: Either on a local machine (for example, my laptop), see [here](./install/install-local), or on a server (for example, an AWS instance), see [here](./install/install-server)

## Experiments
- [**Build an index and query:**](./experiments/index_and_query) users provide a collection of documents such as text files or webpages to build a retriever. Users can then ask questions to obtain relevant results from the provided documents.
- [**Training:**](./experiments/training) Users provide a training dataset to train an xgboost model which governs on how to combine keyword search, vector search and reranking. Users can then use such a model to effectively combine keyword search, vector search and a reranker to get optimal results.
- [**MTEB Experiments:**](./experiments/mteb_retrieval) User want to replicate the MTEB retrieval experiments.
