The Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) framework is pivotal in enhancing AI applications through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs). Within RAG, the Retriever component (denoted as 'R') is fundamental. Presently, vector databases are commonly employed as the default retriever. Yet, in various scenarios, relying solely on a vector database does not yield the best outcomes. The Denser Retriever project is set to establish a unified and extensive Retriever hub. This hub will not only incorporate the vector database, which is optimized for recall, but also integrate traditional keyword-based search methods, optimized for precision, along with alternatives like ML rerankers. Our goal is to deliver an Enterprise-grade AI retriever solution that seamlessly integrates to enhance your AI applications.

## Features

The initial release of Denser Retriever provides the following features.

- Including various retrievers such as keyword search, vector search, hybrid, and optionally with a ML reranker
- Providing step-by-step guidance to setup keyword and vector search services (elasticsearch and milvus), which are utilized to support various retrievers
- Benchmarking on MTEB datasets with different retrievers to assess the quality of various retrievers
- A unified framework for both passage and long documents retrieval tasks
- Demonstrating how to use Denser retriever to power an end-to-end AI chat application

We will set up a Denser Retriever forum and collect feedback to define our future roadmap.

## Principles

Our mission is to develop and deliver enterprise-grade AI retrieval solutions in collaboration with both the research community and industry. As many software solutions focus on retrieval-augmented generation, we are guided by the following principles in our ongoing development:

- We are committed to recommending an optimal enterprise-grade AI retriever, with a primary focus on accuracy while also considering factors such as latency and deployment costs.

- We prioritize scalability, security, and service availability in our recommendations for optimal retrieval solutions, as these are essential requirements for enterprise-grade software.
