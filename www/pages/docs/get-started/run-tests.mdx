# Run Tests

<Callout>
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the unit tests to verify that the installation was successful.
</Callout>

The unit tests are implemented in files starting with `test_` under `tests` directory. You can run the following command to run a single unit test, for example, `test_retriever_general.py`

```python
python -m pytest tests/test_retriever_general.py
```
Alternatively, you can all unit tests with the following command:

```python
python -m pytest tests
```
