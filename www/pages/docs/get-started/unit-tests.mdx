# Run Tests

<Callout>
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the unit tests to verify that the installation was successful.
</Callout>

The unit tests are implemented in files starting with `test_` under [tests]() directory. We have various unit tests to test data loader, elasticsearch, vector search, reranker, and the generalized retriever. The following command runs a generalized test which combines elasticsearch, vector search and rerank.

```python
python -m pytest tests/test_retriever_general.py
```

Alternatively, you can all unit tests with the following command. You will expect to have all unit tests passed.

```python
python -m pytest tests
```
