# Install Keyword Search

We use Elasticsearch under the hood as keyword search implementation due to its high performance and robustness. We follow the [Elasticsearch install guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/targz.html) to install Elasticsearch version 8.13 on an AWS EC2 instance (`t2.medium` with 2 vCPU and 4 GiB Memory). Users may refer to the official elasticsearch doc for greater details. To be self-contained, we list the installation commands required in this doc.

## Download and install archive for Linuxedit

First we download and install archive for linux. The Linux archive for Elasticsearch v8.13.2 can be downloaded and installed as follows:

```bash
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.13.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf elasticsearch-8.13.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-8.13.2/
```
## Run Elasticsearch from the command line

We run the following command to start Elasticsearch:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch
```

When starting Elasticsearch for the first time, security features are enabled and configured by default. Specifically,

- Authentication and authorization are enabled, and a password is generated for the elastic built-in superuser.
- Certificates and keys for TLS are generated for the transport and HTTP layer, and TLS is enabled and configured with these keys and certificates.

The password for the `elastic` user is output to your terminal. Take a note of the this password `es_passwd` which will be used to connect elasticsearch server.

The default setting requires both elastic password and TLS to access elasticsearch service. To make it simple, you can disable TLS by changing the `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` at `config/elasticsearch.yml`. After the change, the ssl config block looks like the following:

```bash
xpack.security.http.ssl:
  enabled: false
  keystore.path: certs/http.p12
```

## Check that Elasticsearch is running

You can test that your Elasticsearch node is running by sending an HTTPS request to port 9200 on `localhost`:

```bash
curl -u elastic:your_es_passwd http://localhost:9200/
```

The call returns a response like this:

```bash
{
  "name" : "Cp8oag6",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "AT69_T_DTp-1qgIJlatQqA",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.13.2",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "f27399d",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_date" : "2016-03-30T09:51:41.449Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.10.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "1.2.3",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "1.2.3"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

## Run as a daemon

To run Elasticsearch as a daemon, specify `-d` on the command line, and record the process ID in a file using the `-p` option:

```bash
./bin/elasticsearch -d -p pid
```

To shut down Elasticsearch, kill the process ID recorded in the pid file:
```bash
pkill -F pid
```
