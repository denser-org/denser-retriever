# Development

## Quick start

Conda package manager is recommended. Create a conda environment.

```bash
conda create -n denser-retriever python==3.10
```

Activate conda environment and install poetry

```bash
conda activate denser-retriever
pip install poetry
```

Then you can run the client using the following command:

```bash
denser-retriever --help
```

or with `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry run denser-retriever --help
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/denser-org/denser-retriever/blob/main/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.


<details>
<summary>Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Codestyle and type checks</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `ruff`.

```bash
make polish-codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `ruff` and `darglint` library

</p>

<details>
<summary>Code security</summary>
<p>

> If this command is not selected during installation, it cannnot be used.

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make check-codestyle && make test && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```
