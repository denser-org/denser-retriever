# üéôÔ∏è Introduction

The Denser Retriever project is set to establish a unified and extensive Retriever hub. This hub will not only incorporate the vector database, which is optimized for recall, but also integrate traditional keyword-based search methods, optimized for precision, along with alternatives like ML rerankers. Our goal is to deliver an Enterprise-grade AI retriever solution that seamlessly integrates to enhance your AI applications.

## Denser Retriever Features

The initial release of Denser Retriever provides the following features.

- Including various retrievers such as keyword search, vector search, hybrid, and optionally with a ML reranker
- Providing step-by-step guidance to setup keyword and vector search services (elasticsearch and milvus), which are utilized to support various retrievers
- Benchmarking on MTEB datasets with different retrievers to assess the quality of various retrievers
- A unified framework for both passage and long documents retrieval tasks
- Demonstrating how to use Denser retriever to power an end-to-end AI chat application
